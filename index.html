<h3>
    <b>
        <p style="text-align:center;"> My name is Ignashious Harrison. I've been a gamer for 20+ years and I have been
            studying game development for 5 years. I have been studying and educating myself on Unity and Unreal Engine.
            I
            have created 3 projects in unity, and prototype for a 3rd person battle arena and I am currently creating a
            prototype for an open world traversal project on Unreal Engine. </p>
