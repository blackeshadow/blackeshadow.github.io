<h3>
    <b>
        <p style="text-align:center;"> My name is Ignashious Harrison. I've been a gamer for 20+ years and I have been
            studying game development for 5 years. I have been educating myself on C# in Unity and C++ along with
            Blueprints in Unreal Engine.
            I
            have created 3 projects in unity, and prototype for a 3rd person battle arena and I am currently creating a
            prototype for an open world traversal project on Unreal Engine. </p>

        <b> Village Defender is the current project that I am working on. It is the prototype of a future 3D melee-based
            story-driven game, centered
            in a fantasy world. Within this prototype, you will see the basis of the combat system and the state
            machines used to manage the animations
            and functions of both your player as well as enemies. This project's current state involves fighting off an
            enemy wave, in which, after defeating all enemies, a new wave with one more enemy will spawn and fully heal
            the player. Further updates are coming at a later time.
