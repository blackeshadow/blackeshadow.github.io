        <p id="para1" style="text-align:center"> My name is Ignashious Harrison. I've been a gamer for 20+ years and I
            have been
            studying game development for 5 years. I have been studying and educating myself on Unity and Unreal Engine.
            I
            have created 3 projects in unity, and prototype for a 3rd person battle arena and I am currently creating a
            prototype for an open world traversal project on Unreal Engine. </p>

            <p id="para2"> This game is a prototype for a game centered around using W to move in the direction the
                player's facing
                and
                avoid enemy orbs pushing you off. This game showcases player tracking, enemy targeting, incorporating
                powerups
                and
                incrementing waves as well was enemy amount.</p>

                as they randomly appear while avoiding the skulls. In this prototype you can see a functioning menu
                screen, UI, game over, and various difficulties all implemented. </p>
